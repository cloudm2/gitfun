Scratch repo to test git features.
This project was created via the command line using hub. Hub is a github project written in Go at https://github.com/github/hub. You can use hub as is or alias it in your .profile or .bash_profile eval "$(hub alias -s)". Hub wraps git and just adds a little sugar to it :).

Another good tool is repo. Repo is a tool created by the Android project to help manage multiple git projects. Repo can be found at https://source.android.com/source/downloading.html
